<p>Hello stranger,</p>
<p>If you read this posts right after I publish it; if you read this post by exploring backward the hundreds of my posts; or if you find it on this old website that nobody updated for several years, I welcome you to my blog and to my first post.</p>
<p>My name is Mathieu Guillame-Bert. Today, I am working as a researcher in a university in the US. I am studding data mining for “large temporal databases”. I a few words, I am trying to make systems able to understand and predict the future. Some people (not me) call this “AI” (i.e. Artificial Intelligence). In my spare time, I make video games, I hack, I play, I read blogs, and I watch video on Youtube. It is not all I do, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>For a couple of years now, I had the desire to make a blog to talk about things I like. Today, I decided to do it. In this blog, I will talk about a lot of subjects: I will talk about my research and computer science in general in a very informal way. I will talk about making video games (e.g. artificial intelligence, mechanics, procedural generation, game design, experiments). I will talk about programming and hackings (e.g. creating my own minimal programming language, playing with c++, playing with phones, playing with the internet!). I will talk about little experiments and DIYs (e.g. my mini crossbow, my non-lethal mousetrap, my hydrogen balloons).</p>
<p>I have quite a precise idea of what will be my first couple of posts, and I have a large amount of subjects that I want to talk about but where I did not figured how to present them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I hope that you will enjoy reading this blog and I will see you in the next post.</p>
