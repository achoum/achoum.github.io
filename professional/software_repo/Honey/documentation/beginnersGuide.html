	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>Event script is a small but high level flow-oriented declarative programming language designed to facilitate the
		pre/post processing and the analysis of symbolic and numerical time series and sequences datasets.</p>

	<p>Some of Event scriptï¿½s notable features are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Simple and compact syntax to make Event Script easy to read and write.</li>
		<li>High level programming that abstract most of the complexity of dealing with <i>large</i> and
			<i>asynchronous</i> time sequence datasets. Event script is so simple that it does not have IF or FOR
			instructions.</li>
		<li>A large library of existing operators developed and experienced through several research projects (Medical,
			financial, fault detection, abnormality detection, etc.).</li>
		<li>Support import and export of Csv files, as well as several other more efficient file formats.</li>
		<li>The possibility to export a script as a graph for easy script reading and debugging.</li>
		<li>Comes with an integrated development environment with syntax coloration, auto-completion.</li>
		<li>Can be interfaced with Event Viewer to real time and/or online visualization of the results.</li>
		<li>Naturally forbid the use of future data to produce result in the past (unless explicitely forced). In other
			work, Event Script naturaly garenties that a script produces similar results on static or and online
			streaming datasets.</li>
		<li>Memory efficient. While processing time series, it only the strictly necessary data is kept in memory. For
			every large datasets, Event Script can be run in a greedy streaming mode for a minimal memory consuption
			(with a higher computational cost).</li>
		<li>Can be run on datasets or real time data flow.</li>
		<li>Can be distributed over several computers (TCP computation distribution).</li>
		<li>Easy to integrate to other project with an easy to use API.</li>
		<li>Easy to implement new operators (either as a script function or a new C++ class).</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Getting Event Script</h2>

	<p>Your next step is to install event script on your computer. Event Script source code and precompiled binaries are
		available at *download place*.</p>

	<p>Compiling Event script has been compiled sucessfully on Visual Studio and GCC 4.9.</p>

	</p>Event script required several libraries:</p>

	<p>Event Script can export export graphs if GraphViz (<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/"
			target="_blank">http://www.graphviz.org/</a>) is installed.</p>

	<h2>Learning Event Script</h2>

	<p>Next, read the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial to Event script</a>. This will give you the basics knowledge to
		write and run simple event scripts.</p>
