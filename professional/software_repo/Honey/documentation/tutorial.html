	<h1>Event Script tutorial</h1>
	<p><a href="index.html">(Back to index)</a></p>


	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>Event script is a small but high level flow oriented declarative programming language designed to facilitate the
		pre/post processing and analysis of symbolic and numerical time series and sequences datasets.</p>

	<p>A script is a file with the ".tit" extension. A script defines a list of operations to apply on a dataset (or a
		set of datasets). Each line geenraly defines one operation. Each operation takes one or several input signals,
		and produces one of several output signals. The output of one operation becomes the input of an other one. You
		will see that some operations do not requiere any input (e.g. the calendar change point generation operation,
		reading of keyboard) and some other do not procude any signal output (e.g. the write to file operation, printing
		on screen).</p>

	<p>
		One of the most particular feature of Event Script is that it does not have conditionnal and loop operators. A
		script is interpreted as a graph/flow of operations. Each operation processes its input, and send it to the next
		operations. "If"s are replaced by operations that can filter data. Because of this flow structure, event script
		can be seemingly applied on a dataset or on an online and continuous flow of data.
	</p>

	<p>
		While event script has its own particular syntax (that you will lean in this tutorial), you can use any editor
		configured with the Perl syntax coloration help event script reading.
	</p>

	<p>Event Script supposes input and output datasets to be Symbolic and Scalar Time Sequence (SSTS). A SSTS is
		composed of <i>channels</i>. Each channel is associated with a <i>name</i> (also called channel symbol) and a
		set of <i>records</i>. Each record is associated with a <i>timestamp</i> (represented as a double float) and a
		<i>value</i> (represented as a floating).</p>

	<p>The following table shows an example of SSTS with three channels. Each record is represented by (x,y) where x is
		the timestamp and y is the value.</p>

	<table class="nicetable">
		<tr>
			<th>
				Symbol
			</th>
			<th>
				Records
			</th>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>e1</td>
			<td> (15.81,1) (16,1)</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>s1</td>
			<td>(5.,-5.1) (20.,5.2) (28,12) (28,13)</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>s2</td>
			<td>(1.,1.1) (2.,1.1) (5.81,12) (12,-1)</td>
		</tr>

	</table>

	<p>Each SSTS channel is either an <i>event</i> or a <i>scalar</i>. Both types are stored similarly and only differ
		in the way the user wants to interpret them. Events generaly represent change points, while scalars generaly
		represent regularly (or semi-regularly) sampled measurements. We will also talk about <i>status</i> channels. A
		status channel is a scalar channel that can only have the value 0 or 1.</p>

	<p>SSTS can also be represented graphically (see figure 1). You can see the drawing representation helping the
		differentiation between events and scalars.</p>

	<div class="figure">
		<div class="content">

		</div>
		<div class="label">
			Fig 1: Example of Symbolic and Scalar Time Sequence (SSTS) with two types of event channels (e1 and e2) and
			two types of scalar channels (s1 and s2).
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>You might be familiar with multivariate time series. This well-known representation is a special case of SSTS.
		Therefore, even if Event Script is designed to work on SSTS, it also perfectly work on time series.</p>

	<p>SSTS can be used to represent a large variety of phenomenons. For example, an event channel can be use to
		indicate the purchase of an item, the activation of a sensor, or the start of a new day. Similarly, a scalar
		channel can be used to count the number of purchase of an item in the last 2 hours, the current temperature, or
		the numerical value of the current hour.</p>

	<p>The simplest and most used file format to store time series is certainly the Csv format. A csv file is a text
		file that represent a two dimentionnal array. The fist column of the array contains a list of timestamps while
		the other columns contain the numerical values of the different scalar channels for each timestamps.</p>

	<p>The csv format is very convenient to store and exange datasets: It is simple to write and read, and it is
		supported by many softwares. However, Csv files requiere all channels to be synchonized, and reading/writing Csv
		is a slow operation in comparison to more optimized binary formats. While Csv is a good first candidate, this
		tutorial also present several other formats supported by Event Script.</p>

	<h2>Running a script</h2>

	<p>To run a script, launch the event script binary with the script file path as the first argument. The file path of
		the input dataset is specified with the "--input" argument. An empty script is a valid script.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example (in the command line)
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			EventScript my_script.tit --input dataset.csv
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Several "--input" can be provided in a single call. In this cases, all the input will be merged together before
		the script is applied.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example (in the command line)
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			EventScript my_script.tit --input dataset_part1.csv --input dataset_part2.csv
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>The output are specified inside of the script (with the operator "save" for example). However, we will see later
		how to specify the output path from the command line using variables.</p>

	<p>The "--graph" option is a very useful option to set Event Script to generate a PNG picture representing a graph
		representation of the script. GraphViz (<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/"
			target="_blank">http://www.graphviz.org/</a>) needs to be installed on your computer to use this option.
		This feature is very useful to read and understand large scripts. The following figure shows the graphical
		representation of a script. You do not have to try to understand the script right now.</p>

	<table>
		<tr>

	<h2>Looking at the result</h2>

	<p>During the writing a complex script, it is generally useful to look and plot the intermediate and final results
		to ensure of the correctness of the script. Many plotting softwares are available for this task (e.g. GnuPlot,
		R, Matlab, Matplotlib, etc.). We however recommend the use of the Event Viewer software avalable <a
			href="{{}}software.html#EventViewer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	<p>Here are some of the many features that make Event Viewer a good candidate to visualize event script results:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Event Viewer supports all output formats of Event Script (event the binary format).</li>
		<li>It can load and display very large datasets (in comparison to other plotting software).</li>
		<li>It allows simple and efficient data "navigation" with the mouse (zooms, translation, anchor, etc.).</li>
		<li>Event Viewer�s display is highly configurable.</li>
		<li>Only one click is necessary reload the result of a script.</li>
	</ul>

	</div>

	<h2>Commentaries</h2>

	<p>Each empty line or line starting with the character "#" is considered a commentary and will not be executed.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			# This is a commentary
		</div>
	</div>

	<h2>Line syntax</h2>

	<p>Each (non-commentary) line is composed of an operator name followed by a list of anonymous argument for the
		operator, followed by a list of named arguments.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			# A command with a single anonymous argument<br />
			derivative "price"<br />
			<br />
			# A command with two anonymous arguments<br />
			sma "price" 50<br />
			<br />
			# A command with two anonymous arguments and a named argument<br />
			sma "price" 50 trigger:"alert"
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Depending on the operators, some anonymous/named arguments can be optional. If they are not specified, they will
		be assigned to a default value.</p>

	<p>Named arguments can be specified in any order. However the order of the anonymous arguments is important.</p>

	<p>Event script allows two types of arguments.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A signal argument takes a single (or a list) of channels.</li>
		<li>A non-signal argument takes a string or a numerical value.</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			# Apply a "simple tailing moving average" (or sma) on the time series called "price" with a time windows of
			50 time units.<br />
			sma "price" 50
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>The sma operator accepts two anonymous arguments. The first one is a signal argument. The second one is a
		non-signal numerical argument.</p>

	<p>The " around arguments are optional. They are mostly useful when the argument has spaces.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			# The three following lines are equivalent<br />
			sma "price" 50<br />
			sma price 50<br />
			sma price "50"<br />
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Operations as well as their arguments are descripted in the <a href="functions.html" target="_blank">Function
			reference</a>.</p>

	<h2>Signal variables</h2>

	<p>Event Script supports two types of variables</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A signal variable (starting with $) contains a list of named channels.</li>
		<li>A non-signal variable (starting with %) is either a string or a numerical value.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Signal variables are used connect operations together. Signal variables can be seen as "pipes": On one side, one
		or several operations put signals into the pipe. On the other side, other operations continuously will get these
		signal. While not entirely accucate, signal variable can be seen as container of signal for static script
		execution : Some operations put signal in a variable. And next, other operations will take and process these
		signals.</p>

	<p>Piping the result of an operation into a variable is done with the "=" keyword.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			# Compute a sma and pipe/store the results in the variable $A<br />
			$A = sma "price" 50
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>The result of an operator can also be aggregated to a signal variable with the operator "+=".</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			# Compute two SMAs and store them in the variable $A<br />
			$A = sma "price" 50<br />
			$A += sma "price" 100
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>At the example of the example, $A contains two channels i.e. the result of the two sma. Note: the two sma results
		are not numerically added.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			# Use the sma results as input for the ema.<br />
			$A = sma "price" 50<br />
			$B = ema $A 10
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>When supplied with a list of channels, most operations will be applied independently on each channel.</p>

	<h2>Non-signal variables</h2>

	<p>Non-signal variables are used to store non-signal arguments.</p>

	<p>Setting a non-signal variable is done with the "set" operator.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			set %window 50<br />
			$A = sma "price" %window
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Non-signal variables can be defined through the command line with the "--option" argument.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			EventScript my_script.txt --option window:50
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Passing non-signal variable throw the command line can be used to specify the output file path in the command
		line.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			*Script*<br />
			Save $result file:%output<br />
			<br />
			*Command line*<br />
			EventScript my_script.txt �input "input.evt" --option output:"output.evt"
		</div>
	</div>

	<h2>Polish Notation Equations</h2>

	<p>Non-signal arguments can be specified by an equation in Polish notation. Numerical Polish notation equations
		start with "=". String Polish notation equations start with "&".</p>

	<div class="example">
		<div class="title">
			Example
		</div>
		<div class="content">
			#The following two lines are equivalent<br />
			sma "price" 30<br />
			sma "price" =10,3,*<br />
			<br />
			# The next following two lines are equivalent<br />
			save "price" file:"output.evt"<br />
			save "price" file:&output,.evt,+
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Available numerical operators are: +, *, -, /, >, <,=, ^,>=, <=, !=, if, sin, cos, tan, log, rand, asin, acos,
				atan and sqrt. Available string operators are: +.</p>

				<h2>Non-tailing operators</h2>

				<p>Event script operators are tailing operators. In other word, not operators can return at time t, a
					value computed with data from t' with t' > t.</p>

				<p>The only exception to this rule is the "echoPast" that can "send data in the past". Note that the
					echoPast function does not work in online streaming execution.</p>

				<p>This constraint ensures that a script runs the same way both online or on completed data.</p>

				<h2>Channel naming</h2>

				<p>Each channel of a SSTS is attached with a name. Variables behave like "pipes". Therefore, different
					variables can contain the same channel. Different variables can contains different channels with the
					same name.</p>

				<p>The result of most operators is returned as a channel or a list of channel. The names of the result
					channels are automatically generated according the input channel names, operator name and operator
					arguments.</p>

				<p>For example, the result of applying the sma operator with a parameter of 30 time units on the channel
					"price" will be named "price_sma[30]".</p>

				<p>Generated names generaly have the following structure: {original channel name}_{operator
					name}[{argument values}].</p>

				<p>Channel names' can be changed with the "rename" and "renameRegexp" operators.</p>

				<p>The "rename" operator changes the name of a channel (or a list of channel) to a new given name.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						# Compute a sma of price and rename the channel as "toto" (instead of "price_sma[30]").<br />
						$A = sma "price" 30<br />
						$A = rename $A "toto"
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Note that if several channels are provided as input, an error will be raised. However, if the option
					"keepAll:true" is specified, no error will be raised and all the input channels will be merged
					together.</p>

				<p>RenameRegexp changes the name of a channel (or a list of channel) to a new name defined by a string
					replacement regular expression.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						# Grab three channels into $A<br />
						$A = echo "price_corn"<br />
						$A += echo "price_tomato"<br />
						$A += echo "price_orange"<br />
						<br />
						# Compute the sma for each of the three channels.<br />
						$B = sma $A<br />
						<br />
						# Rename the results of the sma from "price_corn_sma[30]", "price_tomato_sma[30]" and
						"price_orange_sma[30]" to "30_toto_corn", "30_toto_tomato" and "30_toto_orange".<br />
						<br />
						$C = renameRegexp $B "price_([a-z]+)_sma\[(0-9)+\]" "$2_toto_$1"
					</div>
				</div>

				<h2> The most useful operators</h2>

				<p>The most basic (and useful) operators are: echo, print, sma, filter, save and saveBufferedCsv.</p>

				<h3>Echo</h3>
				<p>Echo just repeats a signal (or a set of signal). If the signal name starts with #, the argument is
					considered as a regular expression applied on all available channels in memory.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						$A = echo "price"<br />
						$A += echo "#price_.*"<br />
						$B = echo $A<br />
						<br />
						# Select all the channels in memory.<br />
						$ALL = echo #.*
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>Print</h3>
				<p>Prints (in the console) the name and statistics of the time sequences inside of a signal variable. An
					optional label argument allows to "label" the output. If every:true, all the event of the time
					sequence are individually printed.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						print $A<br />
						print $A label:"The content of the variable $A"<br />
						print $A every:true
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>Filter</h3>
				<p>Filters the channels coming from a signal variable with a regular expression.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						$A = echo "price"<br />
						$A += echo "amount"<br />
						# $A contains "price" and "amount"<br /><br />
						$B = filter $A "p.*"<br />
						# $B only contains "price"<br /><br />

						# The two following lines are equivalent<br />
						$A = echo #[0-9]*<br />
						$A = filter #.* [0-9]*
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>sma (simple moving average)</h3>
				<p>Sma computes a tailing simple moving average on the data.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						$A = sma "price" 50
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Sma has two additional optional parameters.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><i>minNumObs</i> (default value of 6) defines the minimum number of observations allowed to
						compute the moving average. If less than this number of observations are available, no result
						will be returned.</li>
					<li><i>trigger</i> takes as input a signal and will force the sma operator to only compute an output
						when a trigger signal is provided. By default, the sma operator produces a new output whenever
						it receive an input.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>SaveBufferedCsv</h3>
				<p>SaveBufferedCsv saves the content of a signal variable to a CSV file.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						saveBufferedCSV $A file:output.csv
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Note that if all channels are not synchronized, the csv will be filled with "NA" values.
					Additionally, since all channel names need to be available to write the csv header, this operation
					will keep a full copy of the exported data in memory until the end of the script execution where the
					csv file is written.</p>

				<h3>Save</h3>
				<p>Saves the content of a signal variable to a Evt file.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						save $A file:output.evt
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Unlike saveBufferedCSV, save writes immediately the signal in the file, and remove it from memory.
				</p>


				<h2>Input and output file format</h2>

				<p>Event script support four dataset formats.</p>

				<h3>Csv format</h3>

				<p>A Csv file is a text file that represent a two dimentionnal matrix. The first column contains
					timestamps while the other columns contain the numerical values of the different channels for each
					timestamps.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Time price_orange price_apple<br />
						0 10 11<br />
						2 10.5 11.1<br />
						3.1 10.4 NA
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Csv required all the channels to be synchronized.</p>

				<h3>Evt format</h3>
				<p>A Evt file is a text file where each line specify an event or scalar update. Each line is {time
					stamp} {signal name} {signal value}.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						0 price_orange 10<br />
						0 price_apple 11<br />
						2 price_orange 10.5<br />
						2 price_apple 11.1
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>Evt format is especially useful when channels are not synchronized.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						0 price_orange 10<br />
						1 price_apple 5<br />
						1.1 price_orange 11.1<br />
						5.2 price_apple 2
					</div>
				</div>

				<h3>Bin format</h3>
				<p>A Bin file is a compact binary encoding of a evt file. The binary format is faster to read and write
					than the evt and csv formats. For this reason, the binary format is preferable to the evt and csv
					format in large datasets. Like the evt format, the bin format handles naturally non-synchronized
					channels.</p>

				<h3>Sevt format</h3>

				<p>An sevt is a text file containing paths to other datasets files.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						dataset dataset1.csv<br />
						dataset dataset2.csv<br />
						dataset dataset3.evt<br />
						flush<br />
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>The "dataset" commands accept three options. The first option is the path to the dataset. The second
					option (optionnal) is a prefix to add to each channel names. The last option (also optionnal) is a
					regular expression to filter the channel to load in memory</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						dataset dataset1.csv prefix1.<br />
						dataset dataset2.csv prefix2.<br />
						dataset dataset3.evt prefix3. (dog|cat)_.*<br />
						flush<br />
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>If several groups of datasets are separated by the "flush" command, the dataset times will be shifted
					so that different groups do not overlap. The "sequence" options allows to define the value of
					channel called "sequence" that will be set at the begening of each group. The time distance between
					groups is defined with the "offset" options.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						offset 3600<br /><br />
						sequence 1<br />
						dataset group1_dataset1.csv<br />
						dataset group1_dataset2.csv<br />
						flush<br /><br />
						sequence 2<br />
						dataset group2_dataset1.csv<br />
						dataset group2_dataset2.csv<br />
						flush<br />
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>By default, dataset path are relative to the current directory of the running process. </p>

				<p>The sevt format support many more options that will be described later. Instead, you can specify for
					the path to be relative to the sevt file path with the option "basepath relative".</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						basepath relative<br />
						dataset dataset.csv<br />
						flush<br />
					</div>
				</div>

				<h2>Alternative input dataset definition</h2>

				<p>By default, the input datasets are defined through the command line with the "--input" options.
					Symmetrically, the output datasets are defined in the script with the saving operators.
					To clarify the script, the user can also specify the input and output dataset at the beginning of
					the script with the "AUTODATASET" operator. Autodataset also allows applying script on directories.
					In this case, the script will be applied iteratively on each file of the directories, and the result
					for each file will be saved in a separate file. The path of the output file will be automatically
					put into the %output non-signal variable.</p>

				<p>AUTODATASET requires three named options (the last one is optional).</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Input: Define the input file path or input directory path.</li>
					<li>Output: Define the output file path or output directory path.</li>
					<li>Extension: Define the output extension in Output is a directory.</li>

				<h2>Running modes</h2>

				<p>Event script can be executed in three possible modes: Static, streaming and real-time streaming. The
					mode can be specified by the "--mode" command line option. By default, the mode is set to STATIC.
				</p>

				<p>The static mode (default) loads all the input dataset in memory, and applies each operation one after
					one another. Intermediate results of operations are automatically discarded during the script
					execution as soon as the algorithm detects that it will not be used anymore. Because each operation
					is applied one after another, the static mode is very quick. The static mode is however not suited
					if the dataset cannot be loaded in memory.</p>

				<p>The streaming mode greedily reads and processes a dataset input file line by line. This process is
					much slower that the static mode, but it has very small memory consumption. For example, if applying
					of 10s moving average on a signal using the streaming mode, at most 10s of signal will be keep in
					memory at any time.</p>

				<p>Finally, the real-time streaming mode works similarly the streaming mode, but override the input
					event timestamp with the computer own clock. This mode is suitable for real time online analysis.
				</p>

				<p>As an example, suppose the following program that will be executed in static and streaming mode.</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						<p>$A = sma "price" 10<br />
						<p>$B = derivative $A<br />
						<p>Save $B file:output.evt
					</div>
				</div>

				<p><b>Static execution</b></p>

				<ol>
					<li>The dataset is loaded in memory</li>
					<li>The "price" channel is selected, and a moving average is applied.</li>
					<li>The derivative operator is applied on the moving average results.</li>
					<li>The moving average is removed from memory because it will be not used anymore.</li>
					<li>The result of the derivative is saved in the output.evt file.</li>
					<li>The derivative results are feed from memory.</li>
				</ol>

				<p><b>Streaming execution</b></p>

				<ol>
					<li>The first line of the dataset is read as an event.</li>
					<li>This first event is send to the sma operator how store it and procude a result.</li>
					<li>The results of the sma operator is send to the derivative operator.</li>
					<li>The result of the derivative operator is save to the output.evt file</li>
					<li>The second line of the dataset is read as an event.</li>
					<li>...</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Pseudo flow programming</h2>

				<p>While the execution of Event Script is done in flow, the parsing of the script file is interpreted
					sequentially. Therefore, a signal variable is not equivalent to a flow pipe.</p>

				<p>This concept is illustrated in the following example:</p>

				<div class="example">
					<div class="title">
						Example
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						$A = echo "price"<br />
						$A += sma $A 10<br />
						$A += sma $A 20
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>In this script, the variable $A refers to different flow pipes after each line of the script.</p>

				<p>At the end of the script, $A contains "price",
					"price_sma[10]","price_sma[20]","price_sma[10]_sma[20]".</p>

				<p>This script is represented graphically by:</p>
